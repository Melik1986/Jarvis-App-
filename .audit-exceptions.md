# Audit Exceptions

## ajv <8.18.0 (devDependencies)

- **Severity**: Moderate (ReDoS via `$data` option)
- **CVE**: [GHSA-2g4f-4pwh-qvx6](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-2g4f-4pwh-qvx6)
- **Affected packages**:
  - `eslint@9.39.2` → `ajv@6.12.6`
  - `@eslint/eslintrc` → `ajv@6.12.6`
- **Reason for exception**:
  - ESLint 9.x requires `ajv@6.x` for JSON Schema draft-04 support
  - Upgrading to `ajv@8.x` breaks ESLint (incompatible schema validation)
  - No fix available without downgrading ESLint to v8.x (breaking change)
- **Risk assessment**:
  - **Dev-only dependency** — not exposed in production runtime
  - ReDoS requires malicious schema input to ESLint config (controlled environment)
  - Attack surface limited to development/CI environments
- **Mitigation**:
  - Production audit excludes devDependencies: `npm audit --omit=dev --audit-level=high`
  - CI pipeline configured to audit production dependencies only
  - ESLint config files are version-controlled and reviewed
- **Review date**: 2026-02-18
- **Next review**: When ESLint 10.x is released or `ajv@8.x` compatibility is added

## CI/CD Policy

Production security audit command:

```bash
npm audit --omit=dev --audit-level=high
```

This excludes devDependencies (like ESLint tooling) and focuses on runtime security.
